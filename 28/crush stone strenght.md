## Compressive strength Wikipedia
Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled.Strength and stiffness of compacted crushed concrete.A comprehensive series of drained triaxial compression tests were performed on crushed concrete aggregate (CCA) moist as compacted.When compared to ordinary natural well graded gravelly soils,the peak strength and stiffness increase more significantly with dry density,while the effect of the degree of saturation during compaction is much less significant.
