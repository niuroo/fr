## The Guide to Rocks and Minerals Banded Iron Formation
Banded Iron formations (BIFs) are among the oldest rocks on Earth.They are marine derived sedimentary deposits (i.e.they are rock formed from matter which gathered on ancient seabeds,and were turned to rock by time and pressure) consisting of alternating layers of iron rich rocks (mostely magnetite,siderite,and hematite) and silica (chert).Banded iron formation WikipediaBanded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age.A typical banded iron formation consists of repeated,thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides,either magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) or hematite (Fe 2 O 3),alternating with bands of iron.
