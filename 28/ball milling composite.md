## One Step Ball Milling Preparation of Nanoscale CL 20.
A one step method which involves exfoliating graphite materials (GIMs) off into graphene materials (GEMs) in aqueous suspension of CL 20 and forming CL 20 graphene materials (CL 20 GEMs) composites by using ball milling is presented.The conversion of mixtures to composite form was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X ray diffraction (XRD).Composites: Part B Iowa State Universityeffects of graphene dispersion by ball milling technique.The Al6061 powder and graphene were ball milled at different milling times.The composites were then synthesized by hot compaction in the semi solid regime of the Al6061.A three point bending test was performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the composite.
