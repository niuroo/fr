Civil Engineering · Reinforced Concrete is a structural material,is widely used in many types of structures.It is competitive with steel if economically designed and executed.Advantages of reinforced concrete.Reinforced concrete also has greater compressive strength as compared to most other materials used for construction besides good in tension.

## CV3011 Reinforced Concrete Design
[Lectures: 26 hrs; Tutorials: 13 hrs; Pre requisites: CV2011; Academic Unit: 3.0] Learning Objective.The objective is to equip the students with basic understanding of the behaviour of reinforced concrete structures and to develop the skill to analyze and design basic concrete members.Civil Engineering Free Books,Video Lectures,Pdf Notes,Design of reinforced concrete structures started in the beginning of last century following purely empirical approach Thereafter came the so called rigorous elastic theory where the levels of stresses in concrete and steel are limited so that stress deformations are taken to be linear,RCC DESIGN FREE BOOKS,FREE VIDEO LECTURES OF.
