For overflow ball mills,the charge should not exceed 45% of the mill volume.For grate discharge mills,the charge should occupy about 50% of the mill volume.Bond developed a relationship that can be used to determine the percent charge by volume as a function of the vertical height above the charge,He,and the radius of the mill,R,i.e.AMIT 135: Lesson 6 Grinding Circuit Mining Mill Operator.The mill product can either be finished size ready for processing,or an intermediate size ready for final grinding in a rod mill,ball mill or pebble mill.AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.
