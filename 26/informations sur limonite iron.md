## It's Elemental The Element Iron
Iron is the cheapest and one of the most abundant of all metals,comprising nearly 5.6% of the earth's crust and nearly all of the earth's core.Iron is primarily obtained from the minerals hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).The minerals taconite,limonite (FeO(OH)·nH 2 O) and siderite (FeCO 3) are other important sources.Le mot LIMONITE est valide au scrabbleLe mot LIMONITE vaut 9 points au scrabble.En poursuivant votre navigation sur ce site,vous acceptez que Google et ses partenaires utilisent des cookies pour vous proposer des publicités ciblées adaptées à vos centres d'intérêts et pour nous permettre de mesurer l'audience,cliquez pour en savoir plus.
