In computer science,concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program,algorithm,or problem to be executed out of order or in partial order,without affecting the final outcome.This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units,which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi processor and multi core systems.Notice of concurrent users event reward :: Kritika:REBOOT.Hello.This is Kritika:REBOOT.First of all,Thank you for playing :D Thanks to your support,on 22 and 23,24 November!

## Models and languages for parallel computation ACM.
We survey parallel programming models and languages using six criteria to assess their suitability for realistic portable parallel programming.We argue that an ideal model should by easy to program,should have a software development methodology,should be architecture independent,should be easy to understand,should guarantee performance.Action Research Arm Test RehabMeasures DatabaseInstrument Reviewers.Initially reviewed by the Rehabilitation Measures Team in 2011; Updated by Cara Weisbach,PT,DPT and Wendy Romney,PT,DPT,NCS and the SCI EDGE task force of the Neurology Section of the APTA with references from the chronic stroke population in 2012; Updated by Irene Ward,PT,DPT,NCS and the TBI EDGE task force of the Neurology Section of the APTA in 2012.
