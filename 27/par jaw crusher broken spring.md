## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Choosing the right crusher Buying Guides DirectIndustryThe crushing device consists of a fixed plate and a swing plate called jaws between which the rock is trapped and crushed.A motor and a belt transmit the movement to an eccentric shaft that drives the movable jaw by rotation.A spring returns this moving jaw to let the crushed materials gradually descend into the crusher.
