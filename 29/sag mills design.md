## SAG Mill Liner mgscasting
SAG Mill Liner Design.As a casting foundry,MGS Casting also has own SAG mill liner design.In general terms,lifter spacing and angle,grate open area and aperture size,and pulp lifter design and capacity must be considered.Each of these topics has had a considerable amount of research,and numerous case studies of evolutionary liner design.Technical Program SAG ConferenceContinuous Improvement in SAG Mill Liner Design to Increase Hard Rock Throughput,Taghimohammadi,Grignon,Sherman,& Virani.34.13:45.The Design and Evaluation of SAG Mill Liner Trials,Toor,Valery,Brennan,& Duffy.35.14:00.Grates Plugging in High Diameter SAG Mills: An Overview on Operational Analysis,Olmedo & Rioseco.36.

The SAG mill pinion energy is determined from the SAGDesign™ testwork results as follows : W SDT = revs (16,000 + m s)) (447.3 m s) where : W SDT = AG SAG Specific Pinion Energy from a F 80 of 152.4 mm to a T 80 of 1.7 mm,kWh ton ground revs = Cumulative number of SAG test mill revolutions to 80% passing 1.7mm m s = SAG mill feed sample.CONGA: THE WORLD'S FIRST 42 FOOT DIAMETER 28 MW.does not address the process design or the project economics,but instead focuses on the key aspects of the SAG mill design,GMD design and the associated component manufacturing.This paper also addresses,where applicable,the potential reliability differences between the initially proposed 40 ft SAG mill and the finally accepted 42 ft SAG mill.
