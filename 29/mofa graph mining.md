## Use of frequent itemset mining for learning from graphs,
We also consider three graph mining methods,namely,GraphSig (Mining Significant graphs) [11],MoFa (frequent molecular fragments miner) [7],SUBDUE (interesting sub graphs discovery) [10] 3 Empirical Evaluation In this experiment,we use eighteen datasets from the medicinal chemistry domain.
