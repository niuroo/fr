## Full Wave Rectifier and Bridge Rectifier Theory
The full wave rectifier circuit consists of two power diodes connected to a single load resistance (R L) with each diode taking it in turn to supply current to the load.When point A of the transformer is positive with respect to point C,diode D 1 conducts in the forward direction as indicated by the arrows.When point B is positive (in the negative half of the cycle) with respect to point C.Simple machine BritannicaSimple machine,any of several devices with few or no moving parts that are used to modify motion and force in order to perform work.The simple machines are the inclined plane,lever,wedge,wheel and axle,pulley,and screw.An inclined plane consists of a sloping surface; it is used for raising

## What Are Diodes and What Are They Used For? lifewire
One significant application of diodes is to convert AC power to DC power.A single diode or four diodes can be used to transform 110V power to DC by forming a halfway (single diode) or a full wave (four diodes) rectifier.A diode does this by allowing only half of the AC waveform to travel through it.Rectifier WikipediaA rectifier used in high voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission systems and industrial processing between about 1909 to 1975 is a mercury arc rectifier or mercury arc valve.The device is enclosed in a bulbous glass vessel or large metal tub.

A Diode is an electronic device that allows current to flow in one direction only.It is a a semiconductor that consists of a p n junction.They are used most commonly to convert AC to DC,because they pass the positive part of the wave,and block the negative part of the AC signal,or,if they are reversed,they pass only the negative part and not the positive part.
