Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined.To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore.To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.Cyanide and removal options from effluents in gold mining.Cyanide in effluents resulting from gold mining is known to be the prime candidate for treatment.However,according to a study by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (Canada); ammonia,suspended solids and copper were identified as the most important contaminants in gold mining effluents rather than cyanide.
