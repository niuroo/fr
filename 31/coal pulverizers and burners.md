## Coal burner Wikipedia
The coal in the hopper is conveyed to the coal pulverizer by screw conveyor.The coal pulverizer will crush the coal into pulverized coal.In the coal burner,the pulverized coal mixes with air (High speed air flow is generated by the draft fan on the coal burner),and is ignited by the oil burning igniter.IgnitionPulverized Coal Pipe Testing and BalancingPulverized Coal Pipe Testing and Balancing By Richard F.(Dick) Storm,PE The first step in optimizing combustion system performance is balancing the air and fuel flowing through each of the plant's coal pipes—the pipes that convey the air fuel mix from the pulverizers to the individual burners in the furnace wall.
