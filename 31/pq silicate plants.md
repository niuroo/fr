## THE PQ CORPORATION mdestatemdus
PQ Corporation manufactures liquid sodium silicate from sand (SiO2) and soda ash (NaCO3) in a melting furnace The raw materials are heated up to a temperature of 2300 oF at which time the materials become molten sodium silicate The molten sodium silicate flows into a Rotary Dissolver where it dissolves in waterPQ Sodium Silicates PQ Corporation HomePQ sodium silicates are used in numerous mining and mineral processing systems to improve valu able mineral recovery,while reducing unwanted contaminants.Their chief use in ore flotation is as a deflocculant for dispersing undesired clay.Sodium silicates also inhibit the corrosive wear of grinding media.PQ sodium silicates help

## What is silica Levasil Colloidal Silica Nouryon
Many plants use silica to stiffen stems for holding fruit and to form external needles for protection.The role of silica is less obvious in animals,but each one of us contains about half a gram of silica without which our bones,hair,and teeth could not be formed.Sodium silicates are alkaline solutions with pH ranges of 12 13.The Benefits of Potassium Silicate RollitupSilicate also increase the mechanical strength of the plant to help it in extreme heat and cold swings,salt build up in soils or increased TDS in water,and controls the rate of transpiration of plants
