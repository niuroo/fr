Definition from TechopediaRectifier: A rectifier is an electrical device composed of one or more diodes that converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).A diode is like a one way valve that allows an electrical current to flow in only one direction.This process is called rectification.A rectifier can take the shape of several different physical forms.

## What are the differences between a welding transformer,a.
Feb 15,2015 · 1) Welding transformer is a step down electrical transformer giving an output of 80 to 100 volts (Open circuit No load voltage) from available input voltage.It is designed such that it's voltage drops to 28 to 32 volts on drawing rated current (.AC to AC converter WikipediaThe PWM rectifier is controlled in a way that a sinusoidal AC line current is drawn,which is in phase or anti phase (for energy feedback) with the corresponding AC line phase voltage.Due to the DC link storage element,there is the advantage that both converter stages are to a large extent decoupled for control purposes.

## Matrix Analysis of Electrical Machines A.K.
Electrical Machines May Be Analysed Utilising One Of The Three Methods Viz.Classical Theory,Unified Theory And The Generalised Theory Of Electrical Machines.Generalised Theory May Also Be Regarded As The Matrix Theory Of Electrical Machines Which Requires Only A Knowledge Of The Circuit Equation,Elementary Matrix Algebra And The Principle That The Power Of The System Must Remain.
