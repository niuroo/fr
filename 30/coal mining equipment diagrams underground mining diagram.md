## How Underground Mining Works HowStuffWorks
Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines.Surface mines excavate from the top down,a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association,De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2,500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper uranium mines can reach 6,500 feet,or 2 kilometers.Products & Services Intermountain ElectronicsMine Electrical Systems.Intermountain Electronics understands the needs and stringent physical and electrical requirements for equipment used in underground mining,surface mining,and tunneling environments.We design and build new electrical equipment or recondition and repair existing equipment.

## Longwall mining Wikipedia
Longwall mining is a form of underground coal mining where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice (typically 0.6 1.0 m (2 ft 0 in 3 ft 3 in) thick).The longwall panel (the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 3 4 km (1.9 2.5 mi) long and 250 400 m (820 1,310 ft) wide.Underground mining (hard rock) WikipediaUnderground hard rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate hard minerals,usually those containing metals such as ore containing gold,silver,iron,copper,zinc,nickel,tin and lead,but also involves using the same techniques for excavating ores of gems such as diamonds or rubies.Soft rock mining refers to excavation of softer minerals such as salt,coal.
