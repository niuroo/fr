## Iron Ore Statistics and Information
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3).Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.Chapter 2 Origin and Timing of Banded Iron Formation.HIGH GRADE (60 wt % Fe) hematite iron ore deposits that are hosted by banded iron formation (BIF) are known for all the continents,excluding Antarctica.These deposits are the products of the enrichment of Precambrian BIFs,and they are one of the most important sources of iron ore.
