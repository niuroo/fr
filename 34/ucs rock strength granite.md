• The peak stress is the strength of the rock. It may fail catastrophically if the load frame is "soft".Example below is for a "stiff" frame.• The compressive strength of rock is a function of the confining pressure.• As the confining pressure increases so does the strength.Goodman,Intro to Rock.Predictive model for uniaxial compressive strength for.Determination of the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of rocks is an important task for rock and geotechnical engineering applications.Direct measurement is expensive,time consuming and even infeasible in some circumstances due to the difficulty in obtaining core samples.

Their phenocryst shape and size and abundance of groundmass are also different.The values of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) are the lowest and highest for megaporphyritic alkali granite and alkali quartz syenite,respectively.However,all the four rock types are moderately strong.8.STRENGTH OF SOILS AND ROCKSstrength is the most commonly measured strength parameter and this is also true of rock specimens.For the uniaxial or unconfined compressive strength test a right circular cylinder of the material is compressed between the platens of a testing machine as illustrated in Fig.8.1.The

## Unconfined Compression Test Geoengineer.org
The Unconfined Compression Test is a laboratory test used to derive the Unconfirmed Compressive Strength (UCS) of a rock specimen.Unconfirmed Compressive Strength (UCS) stands for the maximum axial compressive stress that a specimen can bear under zero confining stress.Estimating Rock Mass Strength BM 1997 02The Hoek Brown strength criterion was applied to estimate the strength of the rock mass at the Aznalcollar open pit.It was shown that by assuming disturbed rock mass,a good agreement was found between estimated strength values and back calculated strengths from observed slope failures in the footwall.These values are probably conservative and
