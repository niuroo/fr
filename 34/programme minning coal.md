## Interactive map of coal mines in West Virginia American.
The West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey provides an interactive map of underground and surface coal mining activity in West Virginia.The map shows areas of active and historical coal mining in both underground and surface mines,with separate colors for auger and highwall mining.Coal Mining and the Environment WCAA thorough understanding of subsistence patterns in a particular region allows the effects of underground mining on the surface to be quantified.The coal mining industry uses a range of engineering techniques to design the layout and dimensions of its underground mine workings so that surface subsidence can be anticipated and controlled.
