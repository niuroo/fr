BIF HOSTED IRON ORE DEPOSITS HAMERSLEY STYLE 209 Introduction Much of the following text is summarised from Morris (1980,1985) and Harmsworth et al.(1990),which should be consulted for detailed citation.Though based mainly on research in the.GOETHITE (Hydrated Iron Oxide)Group: Goethite; Uses: important ore of iron,pigment Specimens.Goethite has had a reputation for making rather uninteresting,dull and "dirty" mineral specimens.This is definitely not true of many of the fine specimens available to collectors today.Some good pieces show splendid radiating clusters of.

## Goethite Mineral Physical Optical Properties,Uses.
Goethite is an iron oxide hydroxide,although manganese can substitute for up to 5 percent of the iron.It forms as a weathering product in the oxidation zones of veins of iron minerals,such as pyrite,magnetite and siderite.Goethite may occur with these minerals in the gossan,or iron hat,which is the weathered capping of an iron ore deposit.Effect of 25% Goethite on the Hydrophobicity and Oleate.Flotation tests conducted on the two Iron Duke samples using oleate showed that the presence of goethite adversely affected the flotation response of the hematite but contact angle measurements showed a higher hydrophobicity for the sample containing 25% goethite.Correcting the oleate addition for the changes in surface area still showed that the goethite reduced the flotability of the hematite.

Synonym used for both Goethite and Limonite.Brown Iron Ore: Synonym used for both Goethite and Limonite.Limonite in a ore of iron and is used as a pigment in the manufacture of paints.Besides for a few aesthetic lustrous botryoidal forms of Limonite,as well as the interesting pseudomorphs,Limonite is not of much interest to collectors.Study on kinetics of thermal decomposition of low LOI.The low grade resource has become the major resources to produce iron and steel in India.The majority of low grade hematite iron ore resource at present is fragile in nature because of its association with good amount of goethite,kaolinite,and gibbsite.As per iron ore formation,goethite generates from hematite due to weathering.

The IR spectra of goethite of type 1 iron ore over the 400 4000 cm −1 spectral range is shown in Fig.3 and Table 1.Generally,goethite of this type can be differentiated from goethite of type 3 by an intense broad band due to the bulk hydroxyl stretch at ca.3140 cm −1 and two far less intense bands at 3660 and 3484 cm −1 that can be attributed to the surface hydroxyl groups.Different Types of Iron Ore Mineral Processing & MetallurgyIron formation consists of iron ore such as siderite,magnetite,and hematite,with silica in the form of chert,jasper,etc.generally in bands,but sometimes not distinctly so.The bands of iron ore are at times high grade,but are often mixed with a good deal of silica,the whole making an ore too lean for use without concentration.
