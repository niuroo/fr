## Chapter 6 Roll Crushers ScienceDirect
The nip angle is affected by the distance between the rolls.The nip angle is defined as the angle that is tangent to the roll surface at the points of contact between the rolls and the particle.It depends on the surface characteristics of the rolls.Usually,the nip angle is between 20° and 30° but in some large roll crushers it is up to 40°.Dual roll crushers,how they functionRoll crushers have a theoretical MAXIMUM reduction ratio of 4:1.If a 2 inch particle is fed to the roll crusher the absolute smallest size one could expect from the crusher is 1 2 inch.Roll crushers will only crush material down to a minimum particle size of about 10 Mesh (2 mm).A roll crusher crushes using compression,with two rolls.
