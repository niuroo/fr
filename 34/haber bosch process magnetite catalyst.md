## Why is an iron oxide catalyst used in the Haber process.
The Haber process (also called the Haber Bosch process) is the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas over an enriched iron or ruthenium catalyst,which is used to produce.Haber processThe first Haber Bosch reaction chambers used osmium and uranium catalysts.However,today a much less expensive iron catalyst is used almost exclusively.In industrial practice,the iron catalyst is prepared by exposing a mass of magnetite,an iron oxide,to the hot hydrogen feedstock.

## Introduction to Ammonia Production AIChE
The first commercial ammonia plant based on the Haber Bosch process was built by BASF at Oppau,Germany.The plant went on stream on Sept.9,1913,with a production capacity of 30 m.t. day.Figure 1 is a flowsheet of the first commercial ammonia plant.The reactor contained an internal heat exchanger in addition to those shown on the schematic.Who discovered ammonia? AmmoniaHe created the process in which hydrogen is manufactured on an industrial scale by passing steam and water over a catalyst at high temperatures.The Haber Bosch process turned out to be the most commonly used big scale process for nitrogen fixation.Bosch was appointed the president of I.G.Farbenindustrie AG.
