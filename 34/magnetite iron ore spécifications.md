## BENEFICIATION OF IRON ORE National Institute of.
Major problem faced with the Indian iron ore is that though they are very rich in iron content they also have a high content of gangue material like silica and aluminium which obstruct the iron and steel production as the performance of the blast furnace lowers.Iron ore sample found is a part of banded iron ore formation.Iron ore Anglo American Kumba Iron OreNot all iron ore is created equal.The highest quality and most important iron ores for steelmaking are hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4).Hematite is the more sought after ore and the preferred raw material in efficient steelmaking mills.It accounts for approximately 95% of South Africa's iron ore.
