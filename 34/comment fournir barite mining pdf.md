Abstract.An investigation was undertaken to determine the effects of a large barite mining operation on local ground water quality near Mangampeta,Andhra Pradesh,India.Water samples were collected from drinking water wells in the mining and adjacent regions.This document is part of a larger publicationBarite has high specific gravity,is relatively soft and virtually inert.The main uses of barite are based on its density,colour and radiation absorptive properties.About 90% of all barite produced goes into drilling muds used in petroleum exploration.It is also used as a filler material and wetting agent in.

## Barite (BARIUM) Altervista
Most barite is mined from layers of sedimentary rock which formed when barite precipitated onto the bottom of the ocean.Some smaller mines utilize barite from veins,which formed when barium sulfate was precipitated from hot subterranean waters.In some cases,barite is a by product of mining lead,zinc,silver,or other metal ores.Uzbekistan: Mining,Minerals and Fuel ResourcesThe mining of copper in Uzbekistan takes place in the Sary Cheku and Kalmakyr deposits.Besides mining of copper,the Almalyk GMK is also involved in the mining and processing of lead zinc barite ores obtained from the Uch Kulach deposit in Jizzax Viloyati.In 2010,about 20% of gold and 90% of silver was produced by Uzbekistan's Almalyk GMK.
