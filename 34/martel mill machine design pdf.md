## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE Engineering.
Oct 21,2009 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating,cutter having single or multiple cutting edges.Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy.A milling machine may also be used for drilling,slotting,making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.Design Method of Ball Mill by Sumitomo Chemical Co.Ltd.A ball mill is one kind of grinding machine,and it is a device in which media balls and solid materials (the.Design Method of Ball Mill by Discrete Element Method The grinding rate of gibbsite in tumbling and rocking ball mills using fins was well correlated with the spe
