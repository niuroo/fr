The chemical composition of pure limestone approaches the theoretical composition of calcite (56 percent CaCO and 44 percent CaCO 2).Limestones in which the content of MgO is between 4 and 17 percent are called dolomitic limestones.As the magnesium content increases,limestones pass through a series of intermediate varieties into the dolomites.mobile crusher compositionComposition of Mobile Cone Crushing plant Concrete Crusher.Mobile Cone Crushing plant is mainly used in the field of fine crushing operations,according to different stone and finished product use in stonematerials production operations,instead of impact crusher to produce higher hardness and more fine grained stone materials products,the configuration of the cone crusher can be adjusted.

Limestone mountains have strategic functions as limestone is used as building materials and as raw material in cement industry.Therefore,limestone mining quarry in various areas of limestone mountains in Indonesia is increasingly widespread.The biggest negative impact of limestone mining is the formed open land which is abandoned and unutilized.Chert WikipediaChert occurs in carbonate rocks as oval to irregular nodules in greensand,limestone,chalk,and dolomite formations as a replacement mineral,where it is formed as a result of some type of diagenesis.Where it occurs in chalk or marl,it is usually called flint.It also occurs in thin beds,when it is a primary deposit (such as with many jaspers and radiolarites).
