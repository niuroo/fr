## Bauxite tailings Wikipedia
Bauxite tailings,also known as bauxite residue,red mud,red sludge,or alumina refinery residues (ARR),is a highly alkaline waste product composed mainly of iron oxide that is generated in the industrial production of alumina (aluminium oxide,the principal raw material used in the manufacture of aluminium metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics,abrasives and refractories).Industrial MineralsBauxite is the primary source of aluminium metal,and about 85% of bauxite mined is processed via the Bayer Process to make alumina trihydrate (ATH),then smelter grade alumina (SGA) from which aluminium metal is derived.The respective processes take place in an alumina refinery and aluminium smelter,which may or may not be integrated.
