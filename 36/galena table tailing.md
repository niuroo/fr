from tailings.The tailings were conditioned in a pulp with a pH of 5.3,600g t CuSO 4,400g t FeSO 4 and 10g l frother (MIBC).About 45% of sphalerite was floated in the flotation stage.Chemical analysis and mineralogical compositions of the concentrate is presented in Table 1.Underhand Cut and Fill Mining as Practiced in Three Deep.conditions (Pakalnis et al.2006).All of the mines use either cemented mill tailings or cemented rock fill for backfilling,(Tesarick et al.2003).This paper discusses the similarities and differences between the underhand cut and fill mining methods used at the Lucky Friday,Stillwater,and Galena Mines in the northwestern US (Figure 3).

## Bluebell Mine : foreshore remediation of Galena Bay UBC.
This paper focuses on the management of tailing,concentrates (process fines) and mine water discharge (MWD) fines present on the foreshore of Galena Bay associated with the former concentrator operation.It explores the rationale and planning of the remedial work,and the challenges associated with completing the project.Characterization and assessment of potential environmental.The objective of this study was to examine the potential environmental risk of tailings resulted after precious and base metal ores processing,stored in seven impoundments located in the Aries river basin,Romania.The tailings were characterized by mineralogical and elemental composition.

## Geoenvironmental Characterization of Sulfide Mine Tailings.
Spain has a long mining tradition dating from pre historic times up to the present day.The cessation of mining activity has generated a large amount of mine wastes,most of which represent geochemical hazards.Mine tailings are watery sludge composed of medium to fine grained material,resulting from grinding and mineral processing (e.g.galena,pyrite,sphalerite,and arsenopyrite).BLUEBELL MINE FORESHORE REMEDIATION OF GALENA.Galena Bay.The mine generated approximately 3.9 million tons of tailing from the mine start up in 1952 until closure in 1972.Approximately half the tailing was discharged into Kootenay Lake at the south end of Galena Bay.Some of these process fines accumulated on the beach at the north end of Galena Bay.
