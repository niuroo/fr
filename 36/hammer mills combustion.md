## Fine Grinding Hammer Mill Schutte Hammermill
Hammer mills work on the principle that most materials will crush,shatter,or pulverize upon impact.Material is fed into the mill's chamber through the feed chute,typically by gravity,where it is struck by ganged hammers attached to a shaft that rotates at high speed inside the mill's grinding chamber.Combustion of pulverized coal in entrained or suspended beds in utility and industrial boilers is by far the most common method of coal use.The run .high speed impact or hammer mills and the high speed attrition mills are used in both industrial and utility plants.

## World Coal "Sticky When Wet" Coal Combustion
World Coal "Sticky When Wet" by Rod Hatt Coal Combustion,Inc.Versailles,KY 859 873 0188 Introduction The one element that influences the handling of coal and impacts the operation and efficiency of the plant is water.The amount of surface moisture determines the dustiness and flowability characteristics of a coal.Biomass in coal fired power stations can reduce carbon.This in turn reduces the internal consumption of the power plant,boosting efficiency.Expressed in figures,the energy consumption of hammer mills increases by 21.4 MW per 10 per cent co combustion without preconditioning.Following drying to a water content of 5 per cent by weight,this figure is 4.5 MW per 10 per cent co combustion.
