Bridge Rectifiers.A bridge rectifier is an array of diodes configured to change AC electricity into full wave DC electricity.Suitable for applications that require "smooth and steady" DC supply voltage.Available in a variety of amperage voltage ratings and package configurations.Full Wave Rectifier and Bridge Rectifier TheoryThe full wave rectifier circuit consists of two power diodes connected to a single load resistance (R L) with each diode taking it in turn to supply current to the load.When point A of the transformer is positive with respect to point C,diode D 1 conducts in the forward direction as indicated by the arrows.When point B is positive (in the negative half of the cycle) with respect to point C.
