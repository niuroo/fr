## How does a flowing iron create an electric current? Quora
Apr 10,2017 · Turns out this is a fairly complicated question.[1] First of all,the fact that (solid metallic) iron is ferromagnetic is sort of a red herring when it comes to the Earth's magnetic field.The molten iron in the Earth's outer crust is not ferroma.Not All Iron Is Magnetic (Magnetic Elements)Iron isn't the only element that displays magnetism.Nickel,cobalt,gadolinium,terbium,and dysprosium are also ferromagnetic.As with iron,the magnetic properties of these elements depends on their crystal structure and whether the metal is below its Curie point.α iron,cobalt,and nickel are ferromagnetic,while γ iron,manganese,and chromium are antiferromagnetic.

## Q & A: What are ferrous materials? Department of Physics.
Oct 22,2007 · The word "ferrous" usually refers to materials that have a lot of iron in them.It's common for these materials to be strongly magnetic,but not all of them are.Different types of iron and steel are more or less magnetic.High chromium stainless steel is nearly non magnetic,while pure iron tends to form magnets easily.electromagnetism Will molten iron stick to a magnet.The loss of magnetism at the Curie temperature applies primarily to "induced magnetism like iron sticking to a magnet".Ferrofluid doesn't really include a molten iron; ferrofluid is a collection of many small but mezoscopic particles,"sawdust",and its magnetism doesn't differ so much from magnetism of normal pieces of iron except that it's easier for the particles to change the orientation.

Did you know that it's possible to make slime that is magnetic? Magnetic slime has iron in it and is attracted to a strong magnet.It is super stretchy and so much fun.When you hold a magnet near the slime,it oozes toward it,and the slime will "swallow" up a magnet if you let it go! SO.Ferromagnetism WikipediaFerromagnetism is the basic mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets,or are attracted to magnets.In physics,several different types of magnetism are distinguished.Ferromagnetism (along with the similar effect ferrimagnetism) is the strongest type and is responsible for the common phenomenon of magnetism in magnets encountered in everyday life.
