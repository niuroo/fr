## Manual design of SAG ball rod mill foundations.
Mar 14,2007 · As an engineer who has experience using FEM for the design and assessment of SAG and ball mill foundations,I know that this approach can be time consuming,costly and in some cases not even a hope of being accurate if you don't have appropriate geotechnical and.SAG Mill Operation at Cortez: Evolution of Liner Design.123 PAPER 9 SAG Mill Operation at Cortez: Evolution of Liner Design from Current to Future Operations Julius Stieger1,Process Superintendent Dave Plummer2,Process Maintenance Planner Sanjeeva Latchireddi3,Chief Process Engineer Raj K.Rajamani4,Professor Metallurgical Engineering 1Barrick Cortez Gold Mines Star HC66 Box 1250
