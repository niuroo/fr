## Stirred Milling VERTIMILL® Grinding Mills & Stirred Media.
Stirred Mills have been proven to provide energy savings compared with traditional ball mills.The finer the product required,the more efficient stirred mills will be than a ball mill.The attrition grinding action,vertical arrangement,and the finer media size distribution contribute to make stirred mills more energy efficient grinding machines.ATTRITORS AND BALL MILLS HOW THEY WORK Robert E.Feed size is usually ½ inch or less; product size ranges from 500µ to below 5µ.Ball mills work well on hard,brittle materials.They are not as suitable for grinding elastic,ductile or fibrous materials,or for fine grinding in general.Ball mills can blend and grind at the same time,yielding a fine,intimate mixture.
