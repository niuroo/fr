## Carbon in pulp Wikipedia
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.Carbon Dioxide Attis BiofuelsEthanol producers,including the Attis Ethanol plant,have identified an additional revenue stream from CO2.This ethanol based CO2 by product now makes up nearly one third of the North American supply of CO2.CO2 from ethanol plants is regarded as high grade after some minor processing to remove the small amounts of impurities.
