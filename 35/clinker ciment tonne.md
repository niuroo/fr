Clinker (cement) Wikipedia.In the manufacture of Portland cement,clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter,produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.What are Cement Clinkers? (with pictures)Nov 14,2019 · The most commonly used cement in the world is Portland cement,which is formed at high temperatures that chemically combine the ingredients into new components,including calcium silicates and calcium aluminates.When the cement clinkers are ground with approximately 5% gypsum,they form Portland cement.
